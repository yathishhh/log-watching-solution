First Punic War, (264â€“241 BCE) first of three wars between the Roman Republic and the Carthaginian (Punic) empire that resulted in the destruction of Carthage.
The First Punic War was fought to establish 
control over the strategic islands of Corsica and Sicily. (starts from here)
In 264 the Carthaginians intervened in a dispute between the 
two principal cities on the Sicilian east coast, Messana and Syracuse, 
and so established a presence on the island. Rome, responding to this challenge, 
attacked Messana and forced the Carthaginians to withdraw. 
In 260 a Roman fleet failed to gain complete control of Sicily but opened the 
way to Corsica, from which the Carthaginians were expelled. A second Roman fleet 
sailed in 256 and established a beachhead on the African continent. Carthage was prepared 
to surrender, but the terms offered by Rome were too severe, and in 255 Carthage attacked 
with a new army built around cavalry and elephants and drove the invaders to the sea.
